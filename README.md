# jira-automatic-mail
this project will automatically send all the workers the current open tasks 
it will open jira and log in to an account created for this process
extract all the ticket data and create a mail with sorted content and send it to all the workers 

this will mainly be used to remind workers to close old tickets (cleaning up jira) and also to help workers remember all the curren work tickets 

main 1 extracts per assignee every issue and sends them

main 2 makes an excel with a long and short sheet for each developer that contains all the issues they are working on (or left open in jira) long = all short = oldest is 2 years 
how it will be sent is still undesided maybe upload to teams or split in to multiple excels 1 for each worker and send long once a month and short once a week
